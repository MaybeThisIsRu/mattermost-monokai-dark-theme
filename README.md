# mattermost-monokai-dark-theme

...ish. Monokai-ish.

Reading on GitHub? See [my Gitea](https://git.rusingh.com/hirusi/mattermost-monokai-dark-theme) for source. I push to GitHub manually now and then, but sometimes I forget, and that's OK.

## Motivation

I was bored of the default dark themes.

## How to install

See the Mattermost docs [for how to install](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/theme-colors.html#importing-a-custom-theme).

## Thanks

Thanks to the [Monokai Theme](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/theme-colors.html#monokai-theme) available on the official Mattermost docs, which was a starting point for me. And [Kolormark for the monokai colors](https://kolormark.com/brands/monokai).
