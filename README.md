## Motivation

I was bored of the default dark themes.

## How to install

See the Mattermost docs [for how to install](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/theme-colors.html#importing-a-custom-theme).

## Thanks

Thanks to the [Monokai Theme](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/theme-colors.html#monokai-theme) available on the official Mattermost docs, which was a starting point for me. And [Kolormark for the monokai colors](https://kolormark.com/brands/monokai).
